    "Part of speech tagging for the sentence 'She runs fast' is performed using the Viterbi Algorithm using transition probabilities, emission probabilities, and a trained bag of tagged words. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we split the sentence. It is split into ['She', 'runs', 'fast']. In Viterbi function, we have a state array that starts empty, and holds the states of each tag as they are predicted. We have another list of tags that we extract from the training bag. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each word in the sentence 'She runs fast', we do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we create a list that stores the state probabilities for each tag at the current word.\n",
    "- We have a loop that loops through each tag in the tagged words list, and for each tag:\n",
    "    - If this is the first word in the sentence (aka 'She'), we get the transition probabilities for the start symbol to each tag for the first word. This list is shown in the first transition probability screenshot provided.\n",
    "    - If this is not the first word in the sentence, we get the transition probabilities from the last state to each tag in the tags list. This list is shown as the other two transition probability list screenshots provided.\n",
    "    - For each tag, we compute the emission probability(or the probability of the word appearing given a certain tag).\n",
    "    - For each tag, we then compute the state probabilities, which is the emission probability multiplied by the transition probability.\n",
    "    - We then append this probability to the probability list we created at the beginning of the first for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After we fully run this inside for loop, we find the maximum state probability from the state probability list. This will be what the function tags the current word as.\n",
    "- We then append this highest probability tag to the state list.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all of this, we return a completed list that contains each original input word and it's tag that the Viterbi function came up with.\n",
